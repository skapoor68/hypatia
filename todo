<!-- 2 capacities for satellites
- how many users can a single satellite handle
- total capacity for satellite

Make each user terminal only able to talk to one satellite

- Make each user terminal 'stick' to the satellite it connects with for n seconds
- Start with n = 15

3/15

1. Add support for more satellites
2. 

3/25

1. Produce a table every 10 seconds for number of user terminals connected to each satellite
